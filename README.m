Java OOP Projects Repository ☕️

This repository contains my Java learning journey with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It includes small projects, practice exercises, and implementations of concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

It’s a collection of experiments, exercises, and projects I’ve worked on while learning Java OOP.
