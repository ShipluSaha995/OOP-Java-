Java OOP Projects ☕

This repository documents my journey of learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.
It includes small projects, practice exercises, and implementations of OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

The goal of this repo is to practice and strengthen Java OOP principles through hands-on coding.
