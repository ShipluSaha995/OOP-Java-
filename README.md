# Java OOP Projects Repository ☕️  

This repository contains my Java learning journey with a focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
It includes small projects, practice exercises, and implementations of concepts like **classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction**.  

It’s a collection of experiments, exercises, and projects I’ve worked on while learning Java OOP.
